This is a simple companion script to the book "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain" by Betty Edwards.

The script resizes images, flips them, and draws reference lines on them.

To use:

1. Start a virtual environment
2. Install PIL
3. $ python3 DRSB.py image.png --original

optional argument --original retains the original size of the image while --small will resize it.
